# Hello, Docs!
> A beginner-friendly introduction to writing good docs

Hello! This repo contains resources from a group discussion held at [OSACC](https://opensourceart.cc/) in April 2024. Check out Greg's [notes](./workshop-notes.md) and the current draft of the [p5.js Technical Writing Guide](./p5js-technical-writing-guide.pdf) for inspiration.

The slides can be viewed locally by launching a local server from the repo folder like so:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

They're also viewable [online](https://mcintyre.io/osacc-hello-docs).

Use the number keys 1â€“7 to navigate between slides. 0 returns to the welcome slide. Double-click to toggle fullscreen viewing.
